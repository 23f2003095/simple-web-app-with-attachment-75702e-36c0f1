# Web Attachment Reference App

## Overview / Purpose

This is a minimal, functional web application that displays a webpage referencing an attachment file. The page provides a link for users to download the attachment directly.

## Setup and Usage

1. Save the project files into a directory.
2. Ensure the folder structure includes an `attachments` folder containing `hello.txt`.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. Click the link to download the attachment.

## How the app works

The `index.html` file contains inline HTML, CSS, and a link referencing the attachment located in the `attachments` folder. When opened in a browser, it displays a simple page with a download link for `hello.txt`.

## File list

- `index.html`: The main webpage.
- `attachments/hello.txt`: The attachment file available for download.
